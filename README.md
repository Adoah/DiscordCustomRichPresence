# DiscordCustomRichPresence

Find the latest stable release here: https://github.com/Adoah/DiscordCustomRichPresence/releases.

From there, either download the 64bit or 32bit zip file, unzip it and copy all the files and folders found inside it into a separate folder.

Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me. Click “new app”.

Give it a name that you want (this is the name that will appear in bold) it can be changed at any time.

Copy the client ID, and paste it in the config file.

Click enable rich presence at the bottom of the window.

Then add your photos to the rich presence assets section.

Run the .exe file found in \bin, and it will generate a file called config.txt.

All settings changes will need to be manually done in there for the time being (at least until the config utility is made)

Make your changes to the config, and reboot the program.
